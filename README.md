# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

In this GitHub repository, you will find the code and documentation for our Credit Card Fraud Detection project. We have implemented and evaluated four different deep learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from 2013.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop effective models for the detection of fraudulent credit card transactions. Credit card fraud is a significant concern for both financial institutions and cardholders, and machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have proven to be valuable tools for addressing this issue.

## Models

We have implemented and evaluated four different deep learning models for this project:

1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** We applied CNN architecture to process the transaction data and identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activity.

2. **Autoencoders:** We employed autoencoders, a type of neural network architecture, to learn and represent the underlying structure of the credit card transaction data and detect anomalies.

3. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** LSTM networks, known for their ability to model sequential data, were used to capture temporal dependencies in credit card transactions, aiding in fraud detection.

4. **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN):** We explored the use of GANs to generate synthetic data, enabling us to improve the robustness of our models by augmenting the dataset.
